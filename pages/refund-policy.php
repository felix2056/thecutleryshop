                            <p>We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to
                                request a return. <br><br></p>
                            <p><strong>Damages and issues</strong> <br>Please inspect your order upon reception and
                                contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong
                                item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>Exceptions / non-returnable items</strong> <br>Certain types of items cannot be
                                returned, like perishable goods (such as food, flowers, or plants), custom products
                                (such as special orders or personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty
                                products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or
                                gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.
                                <br><br>Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.</p>

                            <p><strong>Exchanges</strong> <br>The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to
                                return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for
                                the new item.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>Refunds</strong> <br>We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your
                                return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
                                automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some
                                time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>
